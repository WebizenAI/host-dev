Hi there!

Using this secret tool, you'll be able to share some movies from your collection with others!

Why do I call it "secret"? Well, using this requires some advanced Solid skills, and I don't think this is ready for prime-time yet. But [it could be useful for advanced users](https://github.com/NoelDeMartin/media-kraken/issues/7), so give it a try and let me know what you think.

All you need to do is create a container with movies that is publicly readable and use the form below to share it.
