# Import from Good Fil.ms

This is a user-requested addition to Media Kraken, you can look at [this github issue](https://github.com/NoelDeMartin/media-kraken/issues/6) to learn more.

[Good Fil.ms](https://goodfil.ms) is a site to rate, review, and share movie experiences, and while doing so find new films (or rediscover old ones) for you to watch.

If you have a Good Fil.ms account, you can go to your settings page and download a CSV with your data (under the "Cancel My Account" section). Upload this CSV to import your movies to Media Kraken.
