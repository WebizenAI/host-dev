# Import from TViso

[TViso](https://es.tviso.com) is a web service that helps you track movies and tv shows. The development of Media Kraken started as a replacement for TViso, given that [they announced](https://blog.tviso.com/tenemos-que-hablar) their intention to close or sell. But the design goals have differed since.

If you have a TViso account, you can export your data from [here](https://es.tviso.com/my-settings/export-collection) (choose json format).
