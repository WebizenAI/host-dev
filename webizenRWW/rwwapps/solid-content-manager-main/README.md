# Solid Content Manager (formerly Solid IDE)

A syntax-highlighting editor and content manager for Solid pods and projects.

## Work in Progress

I am completely revamping this app.  It will edit and manage pods as before but also has many Solid-specific features such as content-editing via forms. 
A real README coming soon.  In the meantime, I'm @jeff-zucker at https://gitter.im/solid/chat if you have comments or questions.
