# rspamd

maddy has direct support for rspamd HTTP protocol. There is no need to use
milter proxy.

If rspamd is running locally, it is enough to just add `rspamd` check
with default configuration into appropriate check block (probably in
local_routing):
```
checks {
    ...
    rspamd
}
```

You might want to disable builtin SPF, DKIM and DMARC for performance
reasons but note that at the moment, maddy will not generate
Authentication-Results field with rspamd results.

If rspamd is not running on a local machine, change api_path to point
to the "normal" worker socket:

```
check {
    ...
    rspamd {
        api_path http://spam-check.example.org:11333
    }
}
```

Default mapping of rspamd action -> maddy action is as follows:

- "add header" => Quarantine
- "rewrite subject" => Quarantine
- "soft reject" => Reject with temporary error
- "reject" => Reject with permanent error
- "greylist" => Ignored
