// Modifier is the module interface for modules that can mutate the
// processed message or its meta-data.
//
// Currently, the message body can't be mutated for efficiency and
// correctness reasons: It would require "rebuffering" (see buffer.Buffer doc),
// can invalidate assertions made on the body contents before modification and
// will break DKIM signatures.
//
// Only message header can be modified. Furthermore, it is highly discouraged for
// modifiers to remove or change existing fields to prevent issues outlined
// above.
//
// Calls on ModifierState are always strictly ordered.
// RewriteRcpt is newer called before RewriteSender and RewriteBody is never called
// before RewriteRcpts. This allows modificator code to save values
// passed to previous calls for use in later operations.
//
// Modules implementing this interface should be registered with "modify." prefix in name.
