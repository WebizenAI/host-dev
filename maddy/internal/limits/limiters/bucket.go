// BucketSet combines a group of Ls into a single key-indexed structure.
// Basically, each unique key gets its own counter. The main use case for
// BucketSet is to apply per-resource rate limiting.
//
// Amount of buckets is limited to a certain value. When the size of internal
// map is around or equal to that value, next Take call will attempt to remove
// any stale buckets from the group. If it is not possible to do so (all
// buckets are in active use), Take will return false. Alternatively, in some
// rare cases, some other (undefined) waiting Take can return false.
//
// A BucksetSet without a New function assigned is no-op: Take and TakeContext
// always succeed and Release does nothing.
